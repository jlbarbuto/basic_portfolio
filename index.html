                    Hi! I'm Jamie and I am curently learning all the awesome skills it takes to become a full stack web developer!
                    I graduated from North Carolina State Univeresity in May of '16 with a BS in Textile Engineering. I aslo aquired
                    a minor in industrial engineering. I recently ended a self-proclaimed gap year where I backpacked around Europe and
                    later worked at the Walt Disney World Resort. I'm super excited to put my new skills, degree, and recent life
                    lessons to use and build a new career.
                <br>
                <br>    
                    If I could have any super power it would be to have an internal GPS so I would never be lost again and always know
                    the best route to take. I'm a big fan of dessert as well as traveling. Growing up, I loved performing, specifically 
                    in the form of dance. I've dabeled in several eclectic dance styles including modern, ballet, african, and tap.
